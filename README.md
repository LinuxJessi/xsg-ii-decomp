A matching decompilation of **Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse**
for the PlayStation 2.

The goal is readable C source that reproduces the original machine code.
The Sony SDK and public libraries do not need to be recovered.

## Progress

Recovery has not started. There is no published source yet, and the function count is
an estimate. All three files rebuild byte-identical from assembly and data scaffolding,
which counts for nothing below.

<!-- coverage-report:begin -->
Recovered 0 of 5,055 in-scope game function(s) (0.000%).

- `exact_c` (pure C): 0 function(s)
- `exact_c_with_asm`: 0 function(s)
- `exact_asm`: 0 function(s)
- `exact_vu_microcode`: no accepted VU microprogram
- empty-body functions: 0 of the counted function(s) are 8-byte `jr ra; nop` bodies
- These counts come from the tracked object tables, the tracked symbol
  tables and the published source. This tree cannot check that each
  counted function matches its accepted record under its recorded
  contract, independently reviewed: config/vu-build.json are not tracked.

| Version | Target | Functions | Progress |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| NTSC-U | `SLUS_208.92` | 0 / 3,774 | 0.000% |
| NTSC-U | `OV01.OVL` | 0 / 1,259 | 0.000% |
| NTSC-U | `OV02.OVL` | 0 / 22 | 0.000% |

## Building

The historical compilers are 32-bit Linux executables. On 64-bit Ubuntu,
install `libc6-i386` and `python3-venv`. On Windows, use WSL and keep the
checkout and build on a Linux filesystem: the old compilers cannot read some
Windows filesystem metadata and report `Value too large for defined data type`.

You need three things the repository does not contain: your own copy of the
game, the original toolchain, and a Python environment for the disassembler.

### 1. The originals

Extract `SLUS_208.92`, `OV01.OVL`, `OV02.OVL` and the `IOP/` directory from your own
disc image and put them in one folder. Either disc works, because these files are
byte-identical on both (disc 2 boots `SLUS_211.33`, a copy of `SLUS_208.92`).
`config/originals.json` names the three files with their sizes and SHA-256; the build
refuses anything else, so it tells you immediately if you have a different release.
This project reproduces the NTSC-U release.

### 2. The toolchain

`config/toolchain-identity.json` gives, for every compiler and assembler, the version,
the SHA-256 of each payload, and the provenance needed to obtain or rebuild it. These
tools were identified on Xenosaga Episode I, and they fit this game on everything measured
so far.

| Tool | What the build uses it for | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ee-gcc2.96-realconv-lp7` | `cc1` for the game code and the C runtime | the published `ee-gcc2.96` archive, with documented patches to `cc1` |
| `ee-gcc2.9-991111` | `cc1` for the SCE SDK scaffold objects only (out of recovery scope) | the published `ee-gcc2.9-991111` archive, unmodified |
| `ee-as-la29-vsqrt` | assembler for every game and runtime object | GNU as 2.9-ee-991111 built from the pinned `ps2-ee-toolchain` commit with recorded fixes |
| `ee-as-2.9-plain` | assembler for the SCE SDK objects | the same commit, unpatched |
| `ps2dev-binutils` | linker and objcopy of every image, and modern GAS for data objects and retail blobs | ps2dev binutils 2.45.1 |

Lay them out under one directory as `config/toolchain-identity.json`'s
`tools.<id>.dir` / `.path` say. Then:

```bash
python3 -B tools/tu/toolchain.py --check
```

It prints where it looked and what it found, and refuses with the tool's name,
both hashes and the recipe when something is missing or different.

### 3. The disassembler

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Tell the build where those three are

By environment variable:

```bash
export XENO_GAME_DIR=/path/to/extracted-iso
export XENO_TOOLCHAIN_DIR=/path/to/toolchains
export XENO_SPLAT_PYTHON=$PWD/.venv/bin/python
```

or once, in `config/toolchain-local.json` (untracked):

```json
{
  "game_dir": "/path/to/extracted-iso",
  "toolchain_root": "/path/to/toolchains",
  "splat_python": "/path/to/.venv/bin/python"
}
```

Three of the tools are built from source rather than downloaded, so their bytes
depend on the host compiler. A build of the same source that assembles the same
bytes still reproduces the images: accept it one tool at a time with
`XENO_TOOLCHAIN_ALLOW=ee-as-la29-vsqrt,ee-as-2.9-plain,ps2dev-binutils`. The
build then says which check it relaxed.

### 5. Build

```bash
./configure.py      # generate every unit build directory and build.ninja
ninja               # build and compare all three originals
ninja gate          # + per-unit status and the whole-file SHA-256 gate
```

`ninja gate` writes `build/gate.json`. `"result": "pass"` means every one of the
three files came out byte for byte identical to your original.

## Contributing

Recovery has not started. A function will count when its translation unit's source
defines it in C and the whole-file gate passes.
